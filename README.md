Diesel is a lightweight, header-only C library providing cross-platform concurrency primitives.

It offers:

Threads – Easy-to-use abstraction over OS threads.

Mutexes & synchronization – Cross-platform mutexes, spinlocks, and condition variables.

Job system - Simple job queues for task parallelism.

Emulated scheduling - For single-threaded or testing environments, with round-robin random time slices.

Header-only: just include `diesel.h` and you’re ready to go - no compilation or linking required.
