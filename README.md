## Diesel is a lightweight, header-only C library for cross-platform concurrency.

### It provides:

* Threads — Simple, portable abstractions over OS threads.

* Fibers — Run thousands of lightweight fibers concurrently.

* Mutexes & synchronization — Cross-platform locking and sync primitives.

* Job system — Easy job queues for task-based parallelism.

* Emulated backend — For single-threaded or testing environments.

* Header-only: just include diesel.h and go. No separate compilation or linking required.
